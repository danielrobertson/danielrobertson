My name is Daniel and I'm a senior full-stack software engineer focused on building seamless user

## üë®‚Äçüíª Open-source work

- **[Manifest Design System](https://project44.github.io/manifest/)**: Project44's design system,
  built with React, TypeScript, Turborepo, StitchesCSS, and documented with Docusaurus.

## üìö Side projects

When I'm not coding for work, I like to experiment with new technologies to learn and scratch my own
itch. Here's a couple of my own toy projects that I've built and/or currently working on:

- **[Leafly chatbot](https://github.com/danielrobertson/leafly-bot)**: I integrated Leafly's API
  with Facebook Messenger SDK to create a chatbot that can answer questions about cannabis strains
  and interact with the user's Leafly account.

- **[Personal website](https://github.com/danielrobertson/danielrobertson)**: My personal website
  built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Contentful CMS. I'm still deciding how I want to
  position myself as a developer and musician, so it's still a work in progress.

- **[Taggle](https://github.com/danielrobertson/taggle)**: To help me learn Korean, I build a thin
  wrapper around Google search that maintains customizable search prefixes using Next.js and
  localStorage

- **[Wordle Race](https://github.com/danielrobertson/wordle-race)**: Wordle game room where the
  fastest to solve the puzzle wins

- **[Relevant Xkcd](https://github.com/danielrobertson/relevant-xkcd)**: Elastic search engine for
  xkcd comics
